PC 4019 provides for reduced credits where a defendant has a prior conviction of a serious felony. But wait! A juvenile prior isn't a conviction, right? Well, it is for strike purposes. But what about for THIS purpose? Nope, a juvenile prior doesn't trigger the 4019 limitation. People v. Placencia; 2011 DJ DAR 5451; DJ, 4/19/11; C/A 2nd, Div. 6<br><br>RESTITUTION FOR COUNTERFEIT DVDS AND CDS<br>This is a restitution case dealing with counterfeit DVDs and CDs (only 10,000 DVDs and 4,000 CDs). The court ordered $235,000 restitution, based on testimony that this amount was the wholesale value of the counterfeit stuff. The C/A reverses. The correct restitution amount is NOT potential economic loss. There were pay-owe sheets show...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending April 29, 2011</td><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending April 29, 2011<br><br>by Al Menaster<br>LA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>USING NOTES TO REFRESH RECOLLECTION WAIVES THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE<br>The defendant made many notes for his attorney. The C/A here assumes that these were attorney-client communications. But the defendant brought these notes with him to the witness stand and referred to them. The DA demanded disclosure. The C/A rules that using the notes to refresh the defendant's recollection waived the attorney-client privilege, because EC 771 says that stuff used to refresh a witness's recollection is discoverable by the other side. People v. Gray; 2011 DJ DAR 5973; DJ, 4/29/11; C/A 3rd<br><br><br>SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS: RIGHT TO BE PRESENT; RIGHT TO LIFETIME COMMITMENTS<br>The defendant here had a trial on whether he was a sexually violent predator (SVP).

Florida (130 SCt 2011), the US Supremes ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits imposition of a life without parole (LWOP) sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit a homicide.  So can a juvenile constitutionally get what is effectively a LWOP sentence, even if it is not actually LWOP?  Well, Mendoza (188 CA4th 47) says no.  <br><br>Ramirez (193 CA4th 613) says yes, so long as the sentence is a fixed term, not an LWOP term.  In Ramirez, the juvenile defendant got 3 indeterminate life terms, making him eligible for parole in only 120 years.  This C/A deals with a sentence of 5 indeterminate life terms, plus 5 consec. 20-year enhancements, for a total of a minimum term before parole eligibility of 175 years.  This C/A disagrees with Ramirez, and holds that when the sentence imposed effectively precludes ...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending May 20, 2011 by Al Menaster</td><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending May 20, 2011<br><br>by Al Menaster<br>LA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>THE POLICE CAN CREATE THEIR EXIGENCY, SOMETIMES<br>This case got a lot of press, much of it wrong.  This case does NOT determine whether the facts here establish exigent circumstances.  And it does NOT establish a "plain smell" doctrine.  The police were chasing a drug dealer into an apartment complex.  They didn't know which apartment he went into, but they smelled marijuana from one of the apartments.  They knocked and yelled "police."  They heard sounds making them think that contraband was being destroyed.  They broke in and found drugs in plain view.  The Supremes say that for purposes of their decision they are assuming exigency, but they're not actually deciding whether these facts establish exigency.  In fact, they remand for the Kentucky Supremes to decide that issue.  The issue the Supremes do decide is whether the police can create their own exigency.  Answer: yes, so long as ...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending May 27, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster, LA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>DOES MIRANDA APPLY AT PROBATION VIOLATIONS?  NOPE<br>Here's this week's outrage of the week.  Remember Miranda?  This C/A holds that statements made in violation of Miranda may nevertheless be used at a probation violation hearing!  There's some case law saying that a 4th Amendment violation doesn't require exclusion of the evidence at a probation violation hearing, unless that violation shocks the conscience of the court.  (See Hayko, 7 CA3d 604.)  This C/A takes that and runs with it.  Their exception is the related and perhaps lesser standard of whether the police engaged in "egregious conduct."   I, for one, think violating a defendant's Miranda rights is always egregious conduct.  And I think this case is just wrong. People v. Racklin; 2011 DJ DAR 7220; DJ, 5/20/11; C/A 1st, Div. 1<br><br>PROOF THAT A PRIOR FROM OUT OF STATE QUALIFIES AS A STRIKE PRIOR<br>The defendant's prior was for second degree assault from the state of Washington.  Is t...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending June 3, 2011</td><td>by Al MenasterLA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>TURNING WITHOUT A SIGNAL IS ONLY ILLEGAL IF OTHER VEHICLES MIGHT BE AFFECTED<br>The ofr. here was driving in the opposite direction from the defendant, and over 50 feet away. The defendant made a right turn onto another street without signaling. No other vehicle was in the vicinity. The AG claims that this violates VC 22107. Does it? Nope, says this C/A. They say that 22107 prohibits turning without an appropriate signal "in the event any other vehicle may be affected by the movement." Their point is that no other vehicle could have been affected by the turn, obviously including the ofr. The AG's fallback position is that the defendant violated VC 22108, which requires signaling for 100 feet before the turn. The C/A holds that 22108 says how long you have to signal, but not when. The signaling requirement applies only when another vehicle could have been affected by the turn. This rendered the stop illegal and required suppression of the r...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending June 10, 2011</td><td>by Al MenasterLA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>NEITHER INTENT TO APPLY FORCE NOR INTENT TO CAUSE FEAR REQUIRED FOR ROBBERY<br>Remember robbery, PC 211?  Intent to use force or fear to steal property from the person of another?  Nope.  "We hold here that the intent element of robbery does not include an intent to apply force against the victim or to cause the victim to feel fear."  What does qualify as a robbery?  "It is robbery if the defendant committed a forcible act against the victim motivated by the intent to steal, even if the defendant did not also intend for the victim to experience force or fear."     People v.

The police didn't give Miranda warnings initially. In determining whether a minor is in custody for purposes of triggering Miranda, is the court supposed to factor age in? Yep, say the Supremes (over 4 dissents!). "In some circumstances, a child's age would have affected how a reasonable person in the suspect's position would perceive his or her freedom to leave.<br><br>That is, a reasonable child subjected to police questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit when a reasonable adult would feel free to go. We think it clear that courts can account for that reality without doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody analysis." The court says that so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would ...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending June 24, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster<br>LA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>THE CRIMINALIST WHO DID THE TEST MUST TESTIFY<br>Big defense win from the US Supremes. The DA didn't call the criminalist who did the blood test in this DUI case; they called the supervisor. There are a slew of Cal. cases on this, splitting. No more. The US Supremes (5-4) hold that calling a supervisor who didn't perform or observe the test violates Crawford (541 US 36) and Melendez-Diaz (129 S.Ct. 2527). They also reject the claim that this is somehow nontestimonial, saying, "A document created solely for an evidentiary purpose, Melendez-Diaz clarified, made in aid of a police investigation, ranks as testimonial."<br>Bullcoming v. New Mexico; 2011 DJ DAR 9224; DJ, 6/24/11; US Supremes<br><br><br>ALL-PURPOSE ASSIGNMENTS TO JUVENILE REFEREES?<br>A peremptory challenge filed under CCP 170.6 is untimely if it is filed more than 10 days after notice of an assignment for all purposes.<br>The LA juvenile court purported to appoint all referees for all purposes. ...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending July 1, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster - LA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>USING FAXED COPIES OF CERTIFIED COPIES TO PROVE UP A PRIOR<br>Remember the Best Evidence Rule? Repealed years ago (1998) in Cal., replaced by the Secondary Evidence Rule. The DA had certified court records from Alabama, but those records failed to prove that the defendant had personally inflicted great bodily injury (GBI), so they failed to prove that this was a strike prior. The DA then got a faxed copy of a certified record showing personal infliction of GBI. Enough? Yep, sayeth the Supremes. They say, "Thus, under [Evid. Code] sections 1530 and 452.5, subdivision (b), a properly certified copy of an official court record is a self-authenticated document that is presumptively reliable, and standing alone may be sufficient to prove a prior felony conviction." So if it ain't a certified original, it can't come in, right? Oh no, this doesn't preclude OTHER means of authentification. The court says that had the faxed document been the onl...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending July 8, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster - Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office<br><br>COURT OF APPEAL SAYS WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE BREATH TESTING DEVICES<br>The Cal. Supremes have held that we can't challenge the partition ratio used to prove that a defendant was driving at or above .08. Note that we can challenge it on the DUI charge itself, though only if we can show a problem with this specific defendant, not just general problems with partition ratio. (McNeal, 46 C4th 1183.) Here, the trial judge entirely barred the defense expert from testifying that breath testing devices (PAS and breath testing machines) are unreliable because of problems getting pure data about blood alcohol from the intake of air. The expert would testify to problems affecting the amount of alcohol found in the alveolar air supposedly being tested. The C/A says that the exclusion of the expert's testimony was error, with respect to both the .08 and the DUI charges. The C/A says that this differs from partition ratios. Big defense...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending July 15, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office<br><br>CAN A NON-VICTIM BE A VICTIM FOR PURPOSES OF RESTITUTION?<br>The defendant poured gasoline on the victim and lit her on fire. She was injured and the apartment was burned. The defendant pled to aggravated mayhem, and the arson was dismissed. But the trial court ordered restitution to the apartment owner for the fire damage to the apartment. The defense argues that the apartment owner wasn't the direct victim of the mayhem, so the restitution order was improper. The C/A disagrees, saying that the fire was part of the single course of conduct, and the apartment damage was substantially certain to occur and was a direct and immediate result of the mayhem, THAT is enough to establish the apartment owner as an immediate object of the defendant's crime and thus a direct victim.<br>People v. Verni; 2011 DJ DAR 10169; DJ, 7/8/11; C/A 3rd<br><br><br>SPECIFIC VERSUS GENERAL STATUTES<br>The defendant made a false police report to the sheriff, claiming th...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending July 22, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster, LA County Public Defender's Office<br><br>YOU CAN'T AVOID IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES BY GETTING A DISMISSAL AFTER DIVERSION<br>In Lujan-Armendariz (222 F.3d 728), the 9th circuit ruled that when a state grants a first-time expungement of a conviction for certain drug crimes based on successful narcotics rehabilitation, that conviction does NOT qualify as a conviction for federal immigration purposes, provided that probation had never been revoked before dismissal. This meant that a first-time dismissal under old-fashioned drug diversion, Prop. 36, DEJ, or (sometimes) PC 1203.4, would preclude deportation.<br>The 9th circuit now overrules Lujan-Armendariz. So dismissals under these provisions will NOT protect your client. The 9th circuit makes this prospective, so convictions entered before July 14, 2011, can still be wiped out by a dismissal. But not convictions entered afterward.<br>Nunez-Reyes v. Holder; 2011 DJ DAR 10653; DJ, 7/15/11; 9th Cir.

But PC 1054.4 provides that nothing in these provisions is to be construed to limit the prosecution from getting nontestimonial evidence. The criminal defendant here is a corporation. The DA issued a subpoena for internal corporate records about the structure of the corporation. The C/A rules that this information is nontestimonial, since it was voluntarily created by the corporation as part of its business. Since it is nontestimonial and since corporations have no 5th Amendment rights, there's no ban against the DA getting it. Of course, we always thought that nontestimonial information was stuff like being required to stand in a lineup or display tattoos. If this gets thrown in your face, focus on your client HAVING a 5th Amendment right, unlike t...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending August 5, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office<br><br>RIGHT TO PITCHESS DISCOVERY OF COMPLAINTS MADE AFTER THE ARREST<br>The defendant was convicted. He appealed and eventually got federal habeas relief. Back in the trial court, the defendant moved for Pitchess (11 C3d 531) discovery against the officers. The trial court granted the motion, but denied any discovery of complaints made against the officers after the date of the defendant's arrest. The C/A says this is wrong. The defense is entitled to discovery of such complaints, on a showing of good cause. Felicia Grant, LA APD, is successful appellate counsel on this nice win.<br>Blumberg v. Superior Court; 2011 DJ DAR 11477; DJ, 8/1/11; C/A 2nd, Div. 5<br><br><br>FAILING TO PROPERLY INSTRUCT THE GRAND JURY ABOUT MENS REA<br>The defendant was charged by indictment with misuse of public funds. The grand jury was never instructed regarding the mens rea for this crime.

One of the provisions of Prop. 69 required collection of DNA from anyone arrested or charged with a felony. This C/A strikes down the provision requiring collection of DNA from anyone merely arrested for a felony. This is a lengthy opinion, well worth reading, for its discussion of DNA as well as the rules governing the constitutionality of statutes infringing on the right to privacy. The AG argues that DNA collection is a really good way to fight crime. The C/A says that even if DNA testing of arrestees is demonstrably valuable, that doesn't make it constitutional. The C/A says, "We conclude that the DNA Act, to the extent it requires felony arrestees to submit a DNA sample for law enforcement analysis and inclusion in the state and federal DNA da...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending July 24, 2020</td><td>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.<br><br>KICKING DELIBERATING JUROR OFF FOR ALLEGEDLY REFUSING TO DELIBERATE<br>Cleveland (25 C4th 466) says that a deliberating juror can be excused only on a showing of a demonstrable reality that the juror was refusing to deliberate or prejudged the case or wouldn't follow the court's instructions. In this case, the judge kicked off the holdout juror for purportedly refusing to deliberate. The C/A reverses, saying, "Considered altogether, the jurors' testimony demonstrates that Juror No. 12 reached an opinion at odds with the other jurors, who grew frustrated when she was unable to convince them that her opinion was correct and reasonable, refused to accept their arguments to the contrary, and declined to engage in their attempts to change her mind by deliberating in a different manner that did not involve consideration of John Doe's credibility." That's just not enough. There's a good discussion here about th...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending April 15, 2022</td><td>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.<br><br>PAT DOWN SEARCH ILLEGAL FOR LACK OF SPECIFIC FACTS SUPPORTING DEFENDANT BEING ARMED<br>The defendant was stopped by the police for nonworking brake and license plate lights. The officer ordered the defendant out of the car and patted him down, finding a revolver. To pat down a detained suspect, “The officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts together with rational inferences therefrom which reasonably support a suspicion that the suspect is armed and dangerous.” (Dickey, 21 CA4th 952, 955–956.) The C/A discusses many things that the DA claims establish the necessary facts. The defendant was wearing baggy clothing, a hoodie<br> which naturally has bulges. Not enough. Next, the officer said that the defendant had been arrested years before for possession of a weapon. The C/A says this is just prior crimes evidence, again, not enough: “[K]nowledge of a person’s prior criminal involvement (...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending April 22, 2022</td><td>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.<br><br>SHACKLING A DEFENDANT IS PERMITTED ONLY UPON A SHOWING OF RISK OF ESCAPE OR VIOLENCE<br>Another death penalty affirmance. The trial judge ordered the defendant to wear leg chains during trial. The Supremes restate the rules governing shackling and find error, though of course harmless. “[A] defendant cannot be subjected to physical restraints of any kind in the courtroom while in the jury’s presence, unless there is a showing of a manifest need for such restraints.” (Citing Bell, 7 C5th 70, 123.) What qualifies as manifest necessity? The record has to show a flight risk, a safety risk, or evidence that the defendant is likely to disrupt court<br> proceedings. “The need must arise from a current risk of flight, violence, or other disruptive behavior.” “The mere facts that the defendant is an unsavory character and charged with a violent crime are not sufficient to support a finding of manifest need.” (Citing...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending August 19, 2011</td><td>Please note you must LOG IN at the CPDA Members Web Site or you will NOT see this item when you get there...it's only available to current members of CPDA.<br><br>by Al Menaster, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office<br><br>NO NEW TRIAL AS A SANCTION FOR A BRADY DISCOVERY VIOLATION<br>So the DA violates Brady (373 US 83), by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence. But the violation doesn't come to light until after the guilty verdict. The trial judge here granted a defense motion for a new trial as a sanction for the PC 1054.1 violation. Incredibly, the C/A reverses. They claim that a judge can't grant a new trial as a sanction for a discovery violation. Their point appears to be that the discovery sanctions provided for in PC 1054.5 are remedial, and once there's a verdict, there's no way to fix any discovery problems. What is the remedy? A new trial motion where ALL you have to show is that the withheld evidence "would make a different result probable on retrial." This is definitely the out...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending August 26, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office<br><br>JURORS WITH SCRUPLES KICKED OFF DEATH PENALTY JURIES<br>So the judge decides to kick off a juror in a capital case on the grounds<br> that the juror won't be able to set aside his or her opposition to the death penalty. Witt (469 US 412) and Witherspoon (391 US 510) limit the judge's power to do this. The rule has always been that this issue was preserved even absent a specific objection by you on this point. No more. In this death penalty affirmance, the Cal. Supremes "reconsider" that rule and abrogate it. It applies prospectively only, but from now on, you gotta make a specific Witherspoon/Witt objection when your good jurors get kicked off.<br>People v. McKinnon; 2011 DJ DAR 12711; DJ, 8/23/11; Cal.

Supremes about Bryant (131 S.Ct. 1143), the new Crawford (541 US 36) case from the US Supremes. The Cal. Supremes come up with an overly complex six-part test. Really, this comes down to whether the primary purpose of the declarant was to deal with an ongoing emergency or to obtain evidence for trial. The court assures us that the evidence here established that the statements were made to assess the emergency and "to determine defendant's whereabouts and evaluate the nature and extent of the threat he posed."<br>People v.

The dissent correctly concludes that this greatly lessened the burden of proof, because being comfortable with a verdict a day or two after that verdict isn't really an abiding conviction. But the majority dismisses this concern. Second issue. The defendant was impeached while testifying with misdemeanor vandalism. Wheeler (4 C4th 284) permits impeachment of any witness with prior misconduct, even misdemeanor misconduct, so long as that conduct implicates moral turpitude. There's a case saying that felony vandalism implicates moral turpitude. (Campbell, 23 CA4th 1488.) This C/A says that misdemeanor vandalism also implicates...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending September 16, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office<br><br>SEARCHING A CAR REQUIRES PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THERE'S EVIDENCE IN THE CAR<br>The officer lawfully stopped the car. He saw a very young woman passenger in the car and suspected that the defendant was pimping her. The officer asked for ID; the woman didn't have any. The officer ran her and she had a warrant. The officer arrested her. The officer then searched the defendant's car, and found drugs and guns. The 9th circuit says that a search of a car for evidence of a crime is lawful, but it has to be a search for evidence of a crime, and the police need to have probable cause for it, in light of Gant (129 S.Ct. 1710). The police here didn't have PC for the<br> search, because they had no PC to believe that the woman's ID would be found in the car, and that was the only possible evidence they could have searched for.<br>U.S. v.

The defendant here was arrested for being under the influence of a controlled substance. The C/A rules that this DOES give the police a reasonable basis to search for evidence of that offense, namely the drugs themselves or paraphernalia. After Gant, we're going to get a whole jurisprudence on the scope of what's a reasonable basis to search for evidence. I wonder how broad that will turn out to be. Second issue: <br>the police seized the defendant's cell phone and examined text messages, emails, and photographs. The C/A upholds this search under Gant, concluding that there was a reas...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending October 7, 2011</td><td>by Al Menaster, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office<br><br>FINDING THAT PROSECUTOR LIED ISN'T AUTOMATICALLY OUTRAGEOUS GOVERNMENTAL CONDUCT<br>There is no case good enough, no DA misconduct outrageous enough, that an appellate court will actually affirm a dismissal. You might remember this case from the first time around. (Uribe, 162 CA4th 1467.) The C/A reversed for a Brady violation because the defense had not received the videotape of the SART exam of the victim. The C/A assumed that the DA didn't actually know about the tape. On remand, there was a hearing at which the DA testified. The trial judge dismissed the case, finding, get ready, that the testifying DA lied and had thus engaged in egregious prosecutorial misconduct, requiring dismissal.

Self defense requires BOTH an honest and a reasonable belief in the need to defend. But what about imperfect self defense? Imperfect self defense applies when the defendant kills under the actual but unreasonable belief that he or she was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. (See Booker, 51 C4th 141, 182.) The jury was instructed on self defense here, but not imperfect self defense.

With the exception that one prior conviction is enough if the defendant has to register as a sex offender or has a prior serious or violent felony. In March, the C/A ruled that this change was retroactive in the sense that it applied to any case not yet final on appeal. (Vinson, 193 CA4th 1190.) In this appeal, handled by our own Mark Harvis, the court imposed a felony sentence, suspended execution of that sentence, and placed the defendant on formal probation. Within 6 months, the law changed and the defendant moved to withdraw his plea, under PC 1018. PC 1018 permits a defendant to move to withdraw a plea before judgment or within 6 months of probation being granted.

Someone at the FedEx office noticed a smell of marijuana emanating from the package and called the police. The police seized the package. They also smelled marijuana, so they opened it up. Voila: MJ, baby. Wait, didn't they need a warrant? Yep, says this C/A. There are cases saying that the odor of marijuana,<br> coupled with other factors, might justify a search. But the C/A here points out that the police had complete possession of the package, so there was no exigency justifying not getting a search warrant. The C/A cites some old cases from the Cal.

The true issue is whether the gang expert gets to tell the jury that the crime was done for the gang. The Supremes don't answer that question.

The rule, restated by the C/A, is that disbelief of a witness is not affirmative evidence to the contrary. So disbelieving the defendant's denials does not establish the truth of the charges.

A juror consulted his pastor for "spiritual advice on the use of mercy and sympathy in making a decision on penalty." This is juror misconduct. Wait, you say, hasn't the court said that this is not misconduct? You're thinking of Danks (32 C4th 269), where two jurors consulted their pastors in a death case, and the Supremes found no prejudice. In Danks, the court found misconduct but also found that the DA overcame the presumption of prejudice because the jurors had already decided to vote for death.

The San Diego trial court found that these limits were unconstitutional as applied to parolees. The Supremes THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending March 6, 2015 find that the residency restrictions fail even a rational basis test.

North Carolina required this defendant to wear a GPS ankle bracelet for the rest of his life, after he was convicted of a sex offense and found to be a recidivist sex offender. He challenged the ankle bracelet order as violative of his 4th Amendment rights.

The judge relied on the facts in the report to deny relief on the current petition for resentencing. The C/A says that the failure of the defense to object to the use of the 1985 report waives any objection now.

The general rule, which the trial judge relied on, is that the defense is not permitted to present evidence of prison conditions.

The C/A just assumes that 47 applies to juveniles; we can use this to support that position. Next, we're having very inconsistent results in the trial courts on the plea bargain issue.

The Supremes don't actually resolve the issue of whether a court retains jurisdiction to order restitution. Instead, they find estoppel.

Does this apply to cases pending for trial in adult court? The C/A says that 57 is not retroactive (I actually think this is wrong); they say that it applies only prospectively. But this minor's trial hasn't happened yet, so applying 57 prospectively means this minor gets the benefit of 57. This means his adult case gets sent to juvenile court.

In 2006, the C/A in Rubics (136 CA4 452) held that a defendant convicted of hit and run can be ordered to pay restitution for damage when the defendant is sentenced to prison. In 2014, the C/A in this case noted that a defendant sent to prison may only be ordered to pay restitution for losses caused by the criminal conduct for which he was convicted. The court pointed out that Cal. case law has consistently held that the crime of hit and run is the act of fleeing, not the accident itself. The C/A reversed the order of restitution made in this case, ruling that the defendant didn't injure the victim by fleeing. The Supremes granted review. You'll be stunned to hear that we still win.

So does a non-verbal threat alone qualify? Well, Franz (88 CA4th 1426) said no, holding that a throat-cutting gesture alone was insufficient, but the addition of a shushing sound is sufficient for a 422. There's no sound at all in this case; the defendant made gang signs, throat-cutting signs, and simulated shooting a gun by using his hand. The Cal. Supremes rule that the statute is clear and that mere gestures aren't enough. "Statement" excludes non-verbal conduct.

Speaking of oddball names, ever heard of the "single larceny doctrine"? This says that "a person who steals multiple items in an indivisible transaction commits only one theft and thus cannot be convicted of multiple thefts." (Ortega, 19 C4th 686.) This case involves convictions for stealing a car and receiving the stolen property inside the car. The AG concedes; the C/A rejects that concession.

What are those criteria? The defendant has to be indigent. He has to have a mental condition which is relevant to potential punishment (I assume this includes relevant to guilt).

The lower court found that the defendant failed to show prejudice from his lawyer's erroneous advice (that he was in no danger of deportation), because the case against him was so strong that going to trial was hopeless. The US Supremes reverse, finding that a defendant might decide to roll the dice, even at the risk of a worse sentence after trial than the plea offer. Padilla (559 US 356) requires that a defendant show "a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation."

In Muniz (496 US 582) the US Supremes ruled that routine booking questions don't require Miranda, but any questions, including during booking, which the police know or reasonably should know are likely to elicit an incriminating response, do require Miranda.

This C/A agrees with Washington, saying that Crawford limited exclusion of hearsay to testimonial evidence, so the statement has to have been given for the primary purpose of establishing a past fact for use in a criminal trial. Their point is that the declarant Angel didn't know his statements (to paid informants in jail) were going to be used to prove past facts.

What, exactly, can a trial court consider in determining whether a prior qualifies as a serious felony prior and thus a strike? There's a whole body of law allowing judges to consider the entire "record of conviction," which would include stuff like the prelim. transcript. Then there's Apprendi (530 US 466) and Descamps (133 S.Ct. 2276), which bar increasing a sentence based on facts not admitted by the defendant or found true by a jury. The Cal. Supremes resolve this conflict in our favor: "While a trial court can determine the fact of a prior conviction without infringing on the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights, it cannot determine disputed facts about what conduct likely gave rise to the conviction."

Armed with the injunction, the police serve it on anyone they claim is a gang member, then arrest that person for violating a court order if he or she engages in conduct barred by the injunction (conduct like talking to their friends or family members who happen to be gang members). For years, we have argued that arresting our clients for violating an injunction without a prior court determination that our clients were subject to the injunction in the first place is a violation of Due Process.

He came back to the prelim. court restored to competency. The PD demanded a prelim. within 10 days. The judge found that the previous time waiver permitted delay past the 10 days. The C/A disagrees. PC 859b itself requires a prelim. within 10 days of arraignment and plea, or reinstatement of criminal proceedings after a PC 1368 commitment.

The officer told the defendant he wasn't in custody and could leave at any time, but then closed the door and spent 40 minutes interrogating the defendant in a confrontational and adversarial manner. The officer kept telling the defendant that the officer knew that the defendant was guilty and provided face-saving excuses for the conduct.

This C/A says that there's custody triggering Miranda when there's a restraint of the defendant "tantamount to an arrest."

A juror who is so opposed to the death penalty that it would "prevent or substantially impair" that juror's performance as a capital juror may be excused. The trial court must have sufficient information to permit a reliable determination to show that. In his questionnaire the juror said that he did not believe in the death penalty.

What happens when the prior was later reduced to a misdemeanor under Prop. 47? The Cal. Supremes (7-0) rule that a reduction of a felony to a misdemeanor renders the prior unusable to add prison time. PC 1170.18(k) says that a reduced conviction "shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes." Everyone agrees that once a prior is reduced to a misdemeanor, that prior can't qualify under PC 667.5(b) to add a year to a subsequent case.

The C/A says that reliable hearsay is admissible to disqualify a previously convicted defendant from Prop. 64 relief, but probation reports aren't automatically admissible.

But a court may impose sex registration if it finds that the motivation for the crime was for sexual gratification. The court made that finding here under PC 290.006 and ordered the defendant to register for life. The defendant argues that the court should have imposed sex registration as a condition of probation, which would have allowed the court to limit the length of sex registration to the period of probation.

In Banks (61 C4th 788), the Cal.

Rodriguez (135 S.Ct. 1609) holds that a detention beyond what's necessary to resolve any traffic infraction becomes illegally prolonged. The C/A finds that the defendant wasn't detained when he gave the consent. A defendant is detained if a reasonable person would have believed that he wasn't free to leave or otherwise end the encounter. (See, e.g., Brown, 61 C4th 968, 974.)

They say that if an officer finds marijuana in a car, even though the defendant has a medical marijuana card sufficient to legalize the amount of marijuana observed, the officer still has reasonable cause to believe that the defendant might have more marijuana, not legal to possess, and can thus search for it. We say that Prop. 64 now precludes this, relying on H&S 11362.1(c), which says that "no conduct deemed lawful by this section shall constitute the basis for detention, search, or arrest."

The Supremes distinguished Florida v. Nixon (543 US 175), where the court held that conceding guilt was permissible, saying the difference in McCoy was that the client objected to admitting guilt.

Then Romanowski (2 C5th 903) came along. In Romanowski the Supremes ruled that the value of a stolen access card is fair market value; this means "how much stolen access card information would sell for."

So there's no problem applying them to case B. The C/A restates all this. They do, it seems to me somewhat grudgingly, admit that the reduction of 3 of the 6 1-year priors to misdemeanors under Prop. 47 bars adding time for those 3 priors.

At trial, Chapman took the Fifth and refused to testify because of impeachment that the defense developed. The DA was permitted to present Chapman's prelim. testimony. The defense asked the judge to herself grant immunity or order the DA to grant immunity, to permit the defense to call Chapman and impeach him. The judge refused. The C/A affirms. The C/A relies on Masters (62 C4th 1019), which says that judges have no power to grant immunity on their own. When can a judge order the DA to grant a witness immunity?

The defense objected and the judge permitted the DA to present 14 pictures. In cross, the testifying officer admitted that there were only 85 child porn pictures out of the 8,000 total, 1 percent. The judge then let all 8,000 pictures into evidence. The Cal. Supremes rely on the rule of completeness (which I call the part and whole evidence rule), EC 356, which provides that if a party offers part of a statement or writing into evidence, the opposing party can present the entire statement or writing.

PC 12022.7 is the great bodily injury (GBI) enhancement. It has an exception for enumerated crimes and any crime in which "infliction of great bodily injury is an element of the offense." (PC 12022.7 (g).) VC 23103 criminalizes reckless driving. VC 23105 provides that a conviction of reckless driving proximately causing enumerated serious injuries is a wobbler. So can a defendant get a GBI enhancement for reckless driving causing serious injury? If you said no, you fail. The C/A says that the actual crime is reckless driving; VC 23105 is just a sentencing provision, not its own crime. Of course, in Beltran (82 CA4th 693), the C/A rejected this argument in the context of <br>felony evading. But this C/A complains that the C/A in Beltran didn't explain why they rejected this argument.

First issue: the DA aggregated the value of items stolen from two different stores to make this a felony. The C/A says that PC 496, receiving stolen property, is complete upon taking possession of the items. Since there were two separate crimes, the DA couldn't aggregate the offenses to make this into a felony. Second issue: instead of charging the defendant with PC 459.5 shoplifting, the DA charged him with PC 496, receiving stolen property. Of course, PC 459.5 bars the DA from charging burglary or theft when the facts show shoplifting. Does it bar charging 496? Nope, says this C/A, the limitation applies only to burglary or theft, not receiving. This would permit the DA to evade the Prop. 47 limitation by filing a receiving in every case instead of a theft offense.

Supremes have said that restitution for damage caused by the accident in a hit and run can be ordered as a condition of probation. (Carbajal, 10 C4th 1114.) In Martinez (2 C5th 1093) the Cal. Supremes said that when a defendant is sent to prison, victim restitution is limited (because of the wording of the statute) to losses incurred from the defendant's flight but not those incurred from the accident itself, accepting the position that the crime is the fleeing.

This case involves many of the subdivisions of 530.5. The Cal. Supremes have issued two cases recently greatly expanding the scope of Prop. 47 in theft contexts.

SB 1437 ensures "that murder liability is not imposed on a person who is not the actual killer, did not act with the intent to kill, or was not a major participant in the underlying felony who acted with reckless indifference to human life." These changes apply to all pending cases. But what about cases on appeal? SB 1437 includes a procedure for inmates serving prison time for murder to apply for relief. (PC 1170.95.)

In this case, defense counsel conceded that the defendant committed a manslaughter, to try to save him from a murder conviction. At sentencing on the murder, the defendant made a Marsden (2 C3d 118) motion, during which he claimed that he had directed counsel to argue that he was factually innocent. Counsel admitted this. This is the first reversal in California relying on McCoy where counsel merely conceded guilt of a lesser, as opposed to conceding guilt in a death penalty trial.

(Stone, 31 C3d 503.) In Blueford (132 S.Ct. 2044) the US Supremes issued a contrary ruling, saying that retrial on greater offenses, as well as the lessers, is allowed. The issue in this case was whether Blueford abrogated the partial acquittal rule announced in Stone. The Supremes, 6-1, rule that Stone is still the law in California, based on the Cal. Constitution.

This clearly violates the Lent (15 C3d 481) rule and even the juvenile probation condition rule (Erica R., 240 CA4th 907). It simply has nothing to do with the criminal offense.

During this trial, the defendant repeatedly objected to his lawyer's concession that he was the driver of the car that seriously injured a police officer. This was the defense lawyer's strategic attempt to argue against premeditation. Counsel also conceded, over the client's objection, that the defendant possessed firearms. This was conceded in order to argue that the possession was not knowing. The C/A applies McCoy and rules this was error.

In Banks (61 C4th 788), the Cal. Supremes ruled that the Tison/Enmund rule also applies to life without parole (LWOP) sentences as well as death sentences. This barred LWOP sentences where the defendant "was neither a major participant in the crime nor did his actions reflect a reckless indifference to human life." There was no evidence that this defendant acted with reckless indifference during the robbery, but the trial judge denied relief, relying on conduct after the robbery.

In this case the defendant was on probation with a condition that he not refuse to submit to a blood test if he was arrested for a DUI.

The police went to the house and knocked several times, but no one answered. They walked around the house and saw a second door that the officers thought was part of the same house; it actually led to a small connected house. The police opened the door, went inside, and saw the defendant and drugs in plain view. Of course, the DA claimed that this search was legal under the emergency aid doctrine, also called the community caretaking exception.

The DA called Doe 2, another cousin, as an EC 1108 witness. The Doe 2 incident ended up being a mini-trial, with extensive testimony and two additional witnesses on that incident. The DA provided information about a different Doe 2 incident, describing it and saying that the matter was referred to juvenile court because both Doe 2 and the perpetrator (not the defendant) were juveniles. Although the DA had the police report in the separate Doe 2 incident and informed the defense that they had it, the DA refused to provide it or tell the defense that there was Brady (373 US 83) information in it.

The trial judge said no. The C/A begrudgingly says “the evidence was relevant,” but they affirm anyway. They say that the victim gave a statement to the police and testified at the prelim., when she didn’t know about the visa, and then told the same story at trial.

He claimed self defense. The DA was permitted to present evidence of case A as EC 1101 evidence. Unlike other 1101 cases, the prior act wasn’t adjudicated as a crime. There was no evidence case A involved any crime; the police concluded that the death was accidental. The trial court admitted the evidence from case A, finding that case B showed that case A was a crime, and thus case A could be used to prove that the defendant committed the crime charged in case B.

The defendant also has poststrike convictions, but those involved statutory rape (of a woman he later married) and drugs.

The trial judge also directed improper comments and questions to witnesses, openly doubting the credibility of one defense expert by asking argumentative and hostile questions and remarking on the possibility that another defense expert ‘just doesn’t know what he’s talking about.’ When co...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending May 14, 2021</td><td>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.<br><br>SEARCH INSIDE A SHED IS UNLAWFUL WHERE THERE IS NO BASIS FOR THE SEARCH<br>This seems to me an obvious result, but there’s a dissent.

No smoke or smell of smoke was coming from it. He enters the shed, finds a closed mental cabinet inside, opens the cabinet and finds chemicals which become the basis for the charges of possession of explosive materials.

It overlaps with emergency situations but is broader, broad enough to justify almost all police entries into dwellings. The US Supremes, in an extremely short (4 pages) opinion by Thomas, hold that there is no freestanding community caretaking function which permits police to enter dwellings. In a concurrence, Kavanaugh articulates the standard for entries into dwellings based on actual emergencies: what’s required is, “an objectively reasonable basis to believe that there is a current, ongoing crisis for which it is reasonable to act now.” Note that in <br>2019 the Cal.

So is giving this instruction a violation of due process? The Cal. Supremes say no. But they recognize that the certainty instruction is actually wrong, so they direct that the CALCRIM be rewritten. And in the meantime, the certainty portion of the CALCRIM is not to be given: “in the exercise of our supervisory powers, we direct our trial courts to<br> omit the certainty factor from CALCRIM No. 315.” However, the trial court retains discretion to give this language if t...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending June 4, 2021</td><td>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.<br><br>RECUSAL REQUIRED WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS THE DA’S FRIEND AND CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTOR<br>PC 1424 says that the DA must be recused on a showing of a conflict, such that the “circumstances of a case evidence a reasonable possibility that the DA’s office may not exercise its discretionary function in an evenhanded manner.” These are co-defendants charged with conspiracy to obtain concealed firearms permits from the Sheriff in exchange for donations to the Sheriff’s reelection campaign.

The DA’s theory was that this supplied motive.

You would be wrong. The C/A says the evidence was probative to show that the deputy “posed a serious threat to his [the defendant’s] freedom.” The C/A rules that “Casillas had a history of criminal misconduct with a potential for long-term incarceration, which could explain his motive for shooting Deputy Rosales.” The C/A also says that the court mitigated any <br>...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending June 18, 2021</td><td>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.<br><br>PLEA BARGAIN IS VOID IF UNSUPPORTED BY THE ACTUAL FACTS<br>Let’s be honest here.

I’m guessing that was a good result since the filed charges were for human trafficking, robbery, pimping, and pandering. The problem is that to get to the 5-year sentence, the agreement was that the defendant would plead to human trafficking a minor. Although defense counsel said there was a factual basis, and the judge relied on that, there actually wasn’t any evidence that a minor was involved; in fact it was clear that the person being humanly trafficked was an adult.

The Supremes say, “We hold that the act of furnishing is not by itself sufficient to establish personal infliction.” What is enough? “When a defendant administers the drugs without the victim’s consent, the defendant has participated in the injury-causing act and thus may be held liable for personal infliction of the overdose.

Because a case in which the defendant is still on probation is not “final on appeal” (McKenzie, 9 C5th 40, 45), this means that AB 1950 applies to cases where the defendant is currently on probation, absent an enumerated exception.

To establish a prima facie case for relief, all the inmate has to do is check the boxes reciting that the defendant was convicted of first or second degree murder, the defendant wasn’t the actual killer, didn’t aid in the killing, and wasn’t a major participant.

The court imposed a year in the county jail and 5 years of probation. Effective 1/1/21, AB 1950 limits felony probation to 2 years. (PC 1203.1.) The defense seeks shortening of probation to 2 years. There’s an exception to AB 1950 for any “offense that includes specific probation lengths within its provisions.” (§ 1203.1, subd. (l)(1).) PC 191.5(b) has no specific probation term within its provisions. But lesser-included offenses of 191.5(b) do have longer periods of probation. (See, e.g., VC 23152;<br> Schultz, 66 CA5th 887.)

The statute itself applies only to defendants sentenced to LWOP. When this defendant was 15 he was sentenced to 23 years plus 80 years to life in prison.

Citing Clark (63 C4th 522), the C/A lists various key factors relevant to the issue of reckless indifference: use of, or awareness of, the presence of a weapon or weapons; the defendant’s physical presence at the crime scene and opportunity to restrain confederates or aid victims; the duration of the crime; the defendant’s knowledge of any threat the confederates might represent; and efforts taken by the<br> defendant to minimize risks.

(PC 1203.1(l).) AB 1950 says that for these exceptions, the maximum length of probation is the same as “the maximum possible term of the sentence.” Here, the defendant was originally convicted of a felony DUI (an exception) and a felony hit and run (a non exception) and placed on five years of probation. The defense argues that the “maximum possible term” refers to the maximum sentence for each individual count, making the maximum probationary period for his DUI three years.

The trial court then found him in violation and put him back on probation, but “extended” probation by adding the time when he was in warrant status. Because the defendant violated probation and probation had not yet expired, the C/A has no problem with this, holding that “When probation has been summarily revoked and then reinstated within the initial probationary term, the trial court has discretion to<br> extend probation to account for the time when probation was summarily revoked so long as the total period of probationary supervision does not exceed the statutory maximum.” Remember that under Leiva (56 C4th 498) ther...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending February 10, 2023</td><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending February 10, 2023<br><br>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office.<br><br>SB 1437 BARS IMPUTED MALICE MURDER<br>I reported this case in December; the court granted rehearing and now reissues its opinion.

The defendant was alleged to have aided and abetted the perpetrator, who acted with implied malice.

The issue in this case is whether the amended PC 1385 applies when the “enhancement” is a prior strike conviction. You might think that the answer is obvious since a strike prior literally “enhances” the sentence. Nope.

During this time, the officer asked questions to clarify<br> defendant’s supposedly confusing answers for why he was in Utah and where he was headed, and the officer asked the defendant if he was transporting anything illegal.

The RJA provides that a remedy “shall” be imposed if there’s a finding of a violation of the RJA:<br> “Notwithstanding any other law, . . . if the court finds . . . a violation of subdivision (a), the court shall impose a remedy specific to the violation found from the following list.” (PC 745(e).) The RJA lists various remedies, including, “any other remedies available under the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, or any other law.” (PC 745(e)(4).)

Typically, the inmate files a form petition, checking boxes which claim that he qualifies for relief. Is this sufficient to require the issuance of the OSC? “We hold that a petitioner who offers only conclusory allegations of entitlement to relief under section 1172.6, in response to a record of conviction that demonstrates the p...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK’S CASES: for the week March 21, 2025</td><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending March 21, 2025<br><br><br>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office.<br><br><br> <br><br><br>BREAKING EXTERNAL LOCKS ON A TRUCK QUALIFIES AS AUTO BURGLARY<br><br>Auto burglary, PC 459, makes it a crime to gain entry to a locked vehicle with the intent to commit theft. In Toomes (148 CA2d 465), the defendant broke open the trunk lock to open the trunk. The C/A held that the trunk lock was equivalent to a door and so upheld a conviction for auto burglary. The issue here is “whether cutting a gate hasp and lock on M.E.’s exterior truck compartment and cutting a padlock on bins attached<br> to S.S.’s truck fall within the meaning of ‘entering the vehicle’ for purposes of section 459.” The C/A says yes. “Here, Gray used tools to forcefully break the locks on the utility trucks’ storage compartments and bins that functioned analogously to the trunk of a car.” The C/A relies on Toomes, saying, “While Gray attempts to draw a distinction between the e...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK’S CASES: for the week March 28, 2025</td><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending March 28, 2025<br><br><br>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office.<br><br><br> <br><br><br>SHOWING A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES JUSTIFIES RELIEF<br><br>PC 1473.7 permits a court to vacate a plea on a finding that “the conviction or sentence is legally invalid due to a prejudicial error damaging the moving party’s ability to meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual or potential adverse immigration consequences of a conviction or sentence.”<br> The C/A says that “a petitioner must first show error affecting his ability to understand the immigration consequences.” And, “petitioner must also demonstrate prejudice, that is, a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea if he had correctly understood its actual or potential immigration consequences.” The defendant submitted a declaration saying that when he entered his plea, he suffered from mental health challenges relating to his...</td></tr><tr><td>THE WEEK’S CASES: for the week April 4, 2025</td><td>THE WEEK'S CASES: for the week ending April 4, 2025<br><br><br>by Al Menaster, Deputy Public Defender, Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office.<br><br><br> <br><br><br>ALLEGING FACTS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW AN RJA VIOLATION REQUIRES APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL<br><br>The inmate filed a petition alleging a violation of the Racial Justice Act (RJA).
